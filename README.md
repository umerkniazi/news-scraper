# News Scraper (Work in Progress)

This is a personal project to scrape news articles for learning and practice purposes.  
Currently, it only scrapes articles from [Dawn](https://www.dawn.com) and stores them in an **SQLite** database.

## Status

Work in progress.  
Planned updates include:

- Adding more news sources
- Improving data storage and formatting
- Implementing filtering and categorization features

## Data Storage

Scraped articles are saved in the `data` folder as SQLite database files (not included in this repo).  
The `data` folder is kept in the repo with a placeholder file so it’s ready to store your data.
